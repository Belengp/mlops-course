    "Metrics logging in ML using MLflow is like **keeping a record of important measurements** and numbers while training and evaluating a machine learning model. It's like taking notes on how well the model is performing and what factors are influencing its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By logging metrics, we can track and a**nalyze various aspects of the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and others**. It's like keeping score to see how good the model is at making predictions. Logging metrics with MLflow allows us to store and organize these measurements in a structured way. It's like having a special notebook where we write down all the important information about the model's performance during training and evaluation."
