# 👋 MLOps Course Introduction

Welcome to the **MLOps and MLflow course**! In this course, you will learn how to implement **best practices** of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) using the open-source platform **MLflow**. MLOps is a set of practices and tools aimed at improving the collaboration and productivity of Machine Learning (ML) teams, as well as the reliability and reproducibility of ML models in production.

Through this course, you will learn how to use MLflow to manage the **entire ML lifecycle**, from data preparation and **model training to deployment and monitoring**. You will also learn how to create and manage MLflow projects, models, and registry, as well as **how to integrate them with FastAPI** to create and deploy production-ready APIs.

Whether you are a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or software developer, **this course will provide you with the knowledge and skills to implement MLOps** best practices and leverage the power of MLflow to streamline your ML workflow and improve the quality and reliability of your ML models.
